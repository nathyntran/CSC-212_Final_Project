# How the text file examples work:

We have provided sample text files for larger samples here, from the online library database "https://www.fulltextarchive.com/".

### How the given text files work:

The files 1-1.txt, 1-2.txt and 1-3.txt are files that have the entirety of a book on them, so you can take an excerpt from one and create a pattern file to run it against the other programs. You can also run each file against itself (i.e. have a file be both for the original text file and the pattern file parameter).

The file 2-1.txt is the book "The Hunger Games", which we used to test the full time it took for the algorithms to run a search of the entirety of the book against itself, dividing the pattern up into 15 characters per substring.

The file 3-1.txt is the original text file, while the other 3-.txt files are the pattern files.
